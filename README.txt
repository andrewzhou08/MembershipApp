Functionality
————————
The program adds, edits, and removes members from a database. Every member has
their own fields including name, membership number, etc.
The program is able to save the data as an .xml file to a path of the user’s
choice, and load it up later. New xml files can be created as well, and older
ones can be loaded. Backups are also created every 10 minutes.
Reports can be created for only those that owe money and for those who are
seniors. Both reports can be printed or exported as an excel .xls file to
the /output/ folder.
